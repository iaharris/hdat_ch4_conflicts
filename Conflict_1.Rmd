## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
```
Here is my summary of mt cars. Please make comments of this.

## Including Plots

These are our 'conflict' plots:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(mtcars$disp, mtcars$mpg, 
     main = "Fuel efficiency versus displacement", 
     xlab = "Displacement", 
     ylab = "MPG")
summary(mtcars$mpg)
```
Here is the plot and summary


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
